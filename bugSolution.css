To solve this issue, you can use more specific selectors to ensure that your intended styles override other conflicting styles.  You can also use the !important flag, but it's generally discouraged because it can make your CSS harder to maintain.  Another approach is to carefully examine the cascade order and restructure your CSS to ensure the intended styles are applied in the correct order.
